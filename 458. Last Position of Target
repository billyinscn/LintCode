Description

Find the last position of a target number in a sorted array. Return -1 if target does not exist.

Have you met this question in a real interview?  
Example
Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,2,4,5,5], target = 2
Output: 2
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,2,2,4,5,5], target = 6
Output: -1

****************
Hints:
When the target was found, since it asked the last position, we should set start = mid, so that to see whether there is same target
in the right side of the sorted array.
***********************

def findLastTarget (sort, array):
    if array = None:
      return None
    start, end = 0, len(array) -1
    while start < end:
        mid = start + (end -start )/2
        if array [mid] < target:
            start = mid
        elif array [mid] > target:
            end = mid
        else:
            start = mid
    if array [start] == target:
        return start
    elif array [end]  == target:
        return end
    else:
        return -1
